I have recently gotten into JavaScript using p5.. This is my journey

My first day (night time, day before school on a Sunday) was just me exploring what I already knew from other languages and mainly testing them out in JS.. Great success!

Missed day5 due to work on my c# version of Mastermind for my programming class.
